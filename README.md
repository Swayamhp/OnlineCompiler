Online Compiler
This project is an Online Compiler built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Fetch API. The goal of this project is to allow users to write code in a supported programming language, compile it, and view the output directly in the browser.

Features
Multiple Language Support: Users can write and compile code in various programming languages (you can extend this depending on your project).
Code Execution: Supports execution of code written in different languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Real-Time Output: Displays the results or errors from the compiled code in real-time.
Simple Interface: Clean and easy-to-use user interface for inputting code and viewing the output.      
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the webpage and form elements.
CSS: Styling the webpage and UI components.
JavaScript: Logic for compiling and running the code, handling user input.
Fetch API: To make requests to the backend or third-party APIs to compile the code (if using a server-side compiler).
(Optional): Backend service if you are running code on a server or connecting to a third-party API.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
Open the index.html file in your browser.
and open live server

Usage
Open the project in your browser.
Select the programming language you wish to use from the available options.
Write or paste your code into the provided code editor.
Click the "Compile & Run" button.
View the output or any error messages below the editor.
Example:
To compile Python code, select "Python" from the dropdown.
Write your Python code, such as:
python
Copy
print("Hello, World!")
Click "Compile & Run", and the output will be displayed below the editor.
How It Works
User Interface: The user enters code into a text area and selects the programming language.
Fetch API: When the user clicks the "Compile & Run" button, the code is sent to a backend service or third-party API using the Fetch API. The request contains the language selected and the user's code.
Backend Processing (Optional): The backend or third-party compiler processes the code and returns the output or errors.
Display Output: The output or errors are displayed in real-time below the editor.
Future Enhancements
Add support for additional programming languages.
Implement error handling and improve UI/UX for better user interaction.
Add user authentication to save code snippets.
Integrate a more robust backend compiler service.
